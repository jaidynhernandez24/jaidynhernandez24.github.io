    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <h3>I have currently never been employed by an employer that hasn't been myself. I have always been interested in creating my own buisnesses and being self employed.</h3>
    <h2>My Buisness</h2>
    <h3>
      In 2020, at 13, I decided I wanted to turn my creative ideas into a buisness. I began making and selling costumes. By 2026, I have made over 400 sales and $80,000 in revenue.
